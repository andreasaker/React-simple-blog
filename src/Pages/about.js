            React is a JavaScript library, and so we’ll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. <br />
            If you don’t feel very confident, we recommend going through a JavaScript tutorial to check your knowledge level and enable you to follow along this guide without getting lost. <br />
            It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour, but as a result you won’t have to feel like you’re learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.
